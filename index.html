<!-- NOTE: I used code from https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/heatmap_tooltip.html 
  and customized it according to my purposes. I'm not sure if that is appropriate for
  the final project, but I was quite lost trying to figure out how to build it from scratch.

  Things I wanted to figure out:
  - Scale Rectangles (or turn them into circles) by the "NUM_CLIPS" variable
  - My X axis kept cutting off the labels after I rotated them
  - Customize the X axis with year and month labels
  - I wanted to add a small description at the bottom with data credits, but it was cut off

    <h1>Visualizing Fox News' Critical Race Theory Coverage</h1>
    <span class="dateline">July 20, 2022</span>
    <p>Fox News first began its coverage of "critical race theory" in 2020. Then, it was a little-known academic theory that Fox News guest Chris Rufo said was "spreading like wildfire" through the U.S.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 2021, outrage and fear that children were being "indoctrinated" with critical race theory sparked protests at school board meetings nationwide.</p>
    <p>An analysis of 7,500 <a href="https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv" target="_blank">15-second clips</a> of Fox News broadcasts mentioning critical race theory shows how the media outlet's coverage shifted sharply from government trainings to schools in early 2021, long before protests began."</p>

   <p> A new concept is making its way into Fox's CRT coverage: gender. For the past several months, 1 out of every 10 clips mentioning "Critical Race Theory" have also mentioned gender.</p>
